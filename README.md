A collection of scripts I use to automate installation of some components and also just some general notes on installing and setting up things I use regularly.

To run all scripts, simply execute
```bash
./install_all
```

If you want to run the scripts individually, make sure to execute `/scripts/initialize_pacman` beforehand, to initialize pacman-key and populate it with some trusted keys otherwise you may see this error for install scripts
```bash
warning: Public keyring not found; have you run 'pacman-key --init'?
downloading required keys...
error: keyring is not writable
error: required key missing from keyring
error: failed to commit transaction (could not find or read file)
```

## General Tools & Misc

### ./scripts/install_xclip

Installs xclip, which is useful for copying and pasting in and out of [neovim](https://neovim.io/), [mpv](https://mpv.io/) with stuff like [mpvacious](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious) etc.

### Installing 7zz

1. Download the newest version from the [website](https://7-zip.org/download.html)
2. Run `tar -xf <7zz-file-name>.tar.xz`
3. Move `7zz` somewhere in your `$PATH`

### External Optical Drives

Should the steam deck fail to recognize an external optical drive, try
```bash
sudo modprobe sg
```
as referenced [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/17k1975/how_do_i_use_makemkv_with_my_steam_deck_desktop/) and described [here](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=16939&start=90#p81635).



## Japanese Learning

### ./scripts/enable_jp_locale

Enables the japanese locale on the steamdeck. Useful for learners of japanese that have to interact with e.g. zip archives with japanese characters in file names
```bash
LANG=ja_JP 7zz x <zip-archive>
```

### Installing game2text

#### Running the Windows Build Via Bottles

> [!WARNING] 
> Unfortunately attempting to run game2text on SteamOS 3.7 via bottles seems to be broken currently

[game2text](https://game2text.com/) can be used via [bottles](https://usebottles.com/).

1. Install bottles from the Software Center
2. Download [game2text for windows](https://github.com/mathewthe2/Game2Text/releases)
3. Unzip game2text `7zz x  win-game2text.zip `
4. Setup a bottle optimized for gaming
5. Run game2text inside the bottle you just created

#### Building Game2text From Source on the Steamdeck

See: [Game2Text](https://github.com/mathewthe2/Game2Text)

Install the prerequisites
```bash
# This will install tesseract and data for horizontal and vertical japanese
./scripts/install_tesseract_jpn
# This will install virtualenv which we will need for building game2text from source
./scipts/install_virtualenv
# This will install the prerequisites to build game2text
sudo steamos-readonly disable
sudo pacman base-devel glibc linux-api-headers zlib cmake python3 gcc nodejs npm libffi openssl rust tk tcl
sudo steamos-readonly enable
```

Clone Game2Text and prepare its directory contents for building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathewthe2/Game2Text.git
cd Game2Text
virtualenv venv --python='/usr/bin/python'
source venv/bin/activate
pip install virtualenv
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before continuing
> 1. Replace `==` with `>=` for the versions in `requirements.py`
> 2. In `config.ini` replace `browser = default` with `browser = chromium`. See: https://game2text.com/faq/switch-browser/ 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```

You can now run game2text natively in `Game2Text/` via

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python game2text.py
deactivate
```

### Installing MPV and mpvacious

1. Install MPV through the Software Center
2. Follow any of the tutorials out there to setup MPV and mpvacious exactly like you want. I believe the one by [Matt vs Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbg6ztWecbU) was the one I used as starting point.

### Japanese Input

You can use [Fcitx5](https://fcitx-im.org/wiki/Fcitx_5) and `mozc Fcitx5` from the Software Center for japanese input.

### Anki

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is available from the Software Center.

### Logseq

[Logseq](https://logseq.com/) is available from the Software Center.

## Development

### ./scripts/install_lein

Installs [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) for clojure development. I suggest combining this with installing java via [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/).

### ./scripts/install_neovim

Installs [neovim](https://neovim.io/) in `${HOME}/bin/nvim`. By default the nightly version is chosen. You may want to install this via `distrobox` in a dedicated development container.

### ./scripts/install_podman-compose

Installs `aardvark-dns` and `podman-compose` for support of docker-compose files.
